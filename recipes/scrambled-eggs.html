            <p>Cooking isn't about always doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example. 
                Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes great, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs 
                is considered bad form. I don't care; I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese for this; it's awesome!</p>
